### Title
**Security Vulnerability in `afterLockUpdate` Function Due to Missing Access Control**

### Description
The `afterLockUpdate` function in the provided `ZLRewardsController.sol` contract is intended to update a user's registered balance after locking, unlocking, or modifying a lock. However, a critical security vulnerability arises from the absence of sufficient access control mechanisms in this function. Without proper restrictions, any user, regardless of their interaction with the locking mechanism, can call `afterLockUpdate` to update their balance, potentially manipulating their eligibility for rewards.

### Impact
The lack of access control in `afterLockUpdate` has several severe implications:

1. **Unauthorized Balance Manipulation:** Any user can call `afterLockUpdate` to update their balance, even if they haven't engaged in any lock-related activities. This loophole allows for potential manipulation of reward eligibility and distribution.

2. **Distortion of Reward Distribution:** The vulnerability can lead to an unfair distribution of rewards. Users who haven't locked any tokens or aren't entitled to rewards could falsely inflate their balance, thereby claiming rewards that they aren't entitled to.



### Proof of Concept
The vulnerability is evident in the implementation of `afterLockUpdate`:

1. The function is meant to be called post-locking activities like creating locks, unlocking, or increasing amounts through the `ZeroLocker` contract.
2. However, it lacks any checks to ensure that it is only called by these locking mechanisms (like `ZeroLocker`).
3. As a result, any user can call this function directly, updating their balance and potentially becoming eligible for rewards without actually locking any tokens.

4.It becomes evident after looking at the [netspac](https://github.com/zerolend/incentive-contracts/blob/3fbcd817c310d1682d2301d23233f0fc7e7d1f00/contracts/ZLRewardsController.sol#L583C1-L587C8)

### Recommendations
To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Implement Access Control:** Introduce access control checks in the `afterLockUpdate` function to ensure that it can only be called by authorized contracts (like `ZeroLocker`). This can be achieved by using modifiers that restrict function calls to known, trusted contracts involved in the locking process.

```solidity
   modifier onlyZeroLocker() {
       require(msg.sender == address(locker), "Unauthorized: caller is not ZeroLocker");
       _;
   }
```
```diff
- function afterLockUpdate(address _user) external {
+ function afterLockUpdate(address _user) external onlyZeroLocker {
        _updateRegisteredBalance(_user);
    }
```
