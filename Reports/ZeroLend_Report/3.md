### Title
Unrestricted Merge of Locked NFT Balances Due to Missing Expiration Check

### Description
The `merge` [function](https://github.com/zerolend/incentive-contracts/blob/3fbcd817c310d1682d2301d23233f0fc7e7d1f00/contracts/ZeroLocker.sol#L711) in the `ZeroLocker.sol` smart contract is intended to allow users to merge their locked Non-Fungible Token (NFT) balances. The function takes two parameters, `_from` and `_to`, which represent the NFT IDs from which the balance is merged and to which it is merged, respectively. While the function includes checks for distinct NFT IDs and approval validation of the message sender for both NFTs, it crucially lacks a check to ensure that the target NFT (`_to`) has not expired.
NOTE: Source NFT can also be expired
### Impact
The absence of an expiration check on the target NFT (`_to`) in the `merge` function could lead to potential exploitation. Users might be able to merge balances into an expired NFT, which could result in unintended behaviors, such as the revival of expired assets, manipulation of NFT validity periods, or discrepancies in the tracking and management of locked balances. This loophole might be exploited by malicious actors to gain undue advantages or disrupt the intended functionality of the Locks.

### Proof of Concept
The issue lies in the segment of the `merge` function where the locked balances of `_from` and `_to` are accessed and manipulated. After retrieving the `LockedBalance` struct from `locked` mapping for both NFT IDs and calculating the merged value and end time, the function nullifies the locked balance of `_from` and updates `_to` without verifying the expiration status of `_to`. As a result, if `_to` is an expired NFT, it would still accept the merged balance, leading to the aforementioned impacts.
NOTE: Source NFT can also be expired

### Coded POC
To demonstrate the issue, consider the scenario where `_to` is an expired NFT:

1. `LockedBalance` for `_from` and `_to` are retrieved.
2. The function computes the merged value and end time.
3. No check is performed to verify if `_to` has expired.
4. The balance of `_from` is nullified, and `_to` is updated with the new balance and end time.

This process can be executed even if `_to` is expired, demonstrating the lack of expiration validation.

### Recommendations
To mitigate this issue, it's recommended to:

**Implement an Expiration Check:** Introduce a validation step in the `merge` function to check the expiration status of the target NFT (`_to`). The function should reject any merge operation where `_to` is expired.
   
   ```solidity
   require(_locked1.end > block.timestamp && _locked0.end > block.timestamp, "target or Source NFT expired");
   ```
