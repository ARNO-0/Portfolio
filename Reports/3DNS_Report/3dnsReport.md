### M[01] Title Commitment Can Be Processed After Expiry
Severity
    Severity:  ≈ Likelihood: Medium ×
    Impact: Medium 
      
### Description
The CommitmentOrderflow::processCommitment() function in the contract does not include a check for the expiry of commitments. This oversight contradicts the documentation within the code, which explicitly states that the "commitment hash half life" is calculated upon creation of the commitment, indicating that the commitment should only be valid until a certain point in time (block.timestamp + COMMITMENT_HALF_LIFE).
### Impact

The absence of an expiry check allows commitments to be processed even after their intended validity period has expired. This could lead to potential security vulnerabilities or inconsistencies within the system, as expired commitments might not reflect the current state or intentions of the parties involved.

###  Proof of Concept

Reviewing the code, we find that the processCommitment function does not validate whether the commitment has expired before proceeding with its processing. According to the comment in the code, there is an expectation that a commitment's lifespan is limited (commitment hash half life), but this logic is not enforced in the function's implementation.
###  Recommendations

Implement an Expiry Check: Modify the _commitment__process function to include a validation step that checks if the commitment's expiry time (revokableAt_) has passed.
```solidity

require(block.timestamp < revokableAt_, "Commitment expired and cannot be processed");
```

### H[01] Commitment of Type TRANSFER Can Be Revoked Immediately

### Description

In the CommitmentOrderflow smart contract, a specific logic flow is intended to manage the lifecycle of domain name transfer commitments. However, an oversight in the contract's initialization process leads to a critical vulnerability. The function _commitment__store() calculates the revocableAt_ timestamp for commitments of type TRANSFER using the expression uint64(block.timestamp + Storage.COMMITMENT_HALF_LIFE__TRANSFER()). Ideally, this should set a future timestamp until which the commitment cannot be revoked, based on a predefined half-life period. Unfortunately, due to the Storage.initialize() function not initializing the COMMITMENT_HALF_LIFE__TRANSFER value, it defaults to 0. As a result, the revocableAt_ timestamp is set to the current block timestamp, inadvertently allowing immediate revocation of TRANSFER type commitments.

### Impact

This vulnerability severely undermines the security and integrity of the domain transfer process within the platform. It allows users to revoke transfer commitments immediately after making them, potentially enabling malicious activities such as backing-running.
### Proof of Concept

1.Commitment Creation: A user creates a commitment of type TRANSFER, triggering the _commitment__store() function.

2.RevocableAt Calculation: The function calculates revocableAt_ using the uninitialized COMMITMENT_HALF_LIFE__TRANSFER, resulting in revocableAt_ being equal to the current block.timestamp.

    revocableAt_ = uint64(block.timestamp + Storage.COMMITMENT_HALF_LIFE__TRANSFER()); // Here, COMMITMENT_HALF_LIFE__TRANSFER() defaults to 0

3.Immediate Revocation: Given that revocableAt_ is set to the current block timestamp, the commitment is immediately eligible for revocation, bypassing the intended lock period.

### Recommendations

Immediate Patch: As an immediate measure, ensure that Storage.initialize() properly initializes the COMMITMENT_HALF_LIFE__TRANSFER variable to a sensible default value that represents the intended commitment half-life for domain transfers.
