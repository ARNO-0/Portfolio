### Title

Arithmetic Underflow in `_checkpointTotalSupply` Function of `FeeDistributor.sol`

### Description

The `_checkpointTotalSupply` function in the `FeeDistributor.sol` contract is vulnerable to an arithmetic underflow. The function, designed to compute the `veSupply` at weekly intervals, uses the expression `(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)` for calculation. However, this expression can yield a negative value if `pt.slope * dt` exceeds `pt.bias`. Since Solidity handles negative numbers poorly, it results in an underflow where a large unsigned number is stored in `veSupply[t]` instead of the intended zero or positive value.

```solidity
veSupply[t] = Math.max(uint128(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt), 0);
```

This line aims to prevent negative balances, but due to the potential underflow, it could mistakenly assign an extremely large value to `veSupply[t]`.

Similar vulnerabilities are observed in other instances within the contract:
[Instance 1](https://github.com/zerolend/incentive-contracts/blob/3fbcd817c310d1682d2301d23233f0fc7e7d1f00/contracts/FeeDistributor.sol#L227C1-L230C1)

### Impact

This underflow vulnerability could significantly impact the FeeDistributor's operations:

1. **Incorrect Reward Calculations:** The miscalculated `veSupply` values can lead to incorrect reward distributions.
2. **Systemic Risks for Dependent Protocols:** Protocols relying on `veSupply` for calculations or decisions could suffer from cascading failures or unexpected behaviors due to these incorrect values.


### Proof of Concept

The vulnerability is present in the `_checkpointTotalSupply` function, particularly at:

```solidity
veSupply[t] = Math.max(uint128(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt), 0);
```

### Tools Used

-  Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

### Recommendations

To mitigate this issue, the calculation should be adjusted to ensure that negative values are handled correctly, preventing underflow:


```diff
- veSupply[t] = Math.max(uint128(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt), 0);
+ veSupply[t] = uint128(Math.max(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt, 0));
-uint256 balanceOf = Math.max(uint128(oldUserPoint.bias - dt * oldUserPoint.slope),0);
+uint256 balanceOf = uint128(Math.max(oldUserPoint.bias - dt * oldUserPoint.slope,0));
```
