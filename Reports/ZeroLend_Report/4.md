### Title

Flawed Total Supply Update in `ZeroLocker.sol` During `merge()` Function Execution

### Description

In the `ZeroLocker.sol` contract, the `merge(uint256 _from, uint256 _to)` function is designed to consolidate the locks of two NFTs. This function, crucial for managing locked tokens, utilizes the `_depositFor()` function for merging. However, a significant issue is identified in this implementation: the `supply` state variable, representing the total supply of locked tokens, is inaccurately incremented during the merge operation. This increment occurs because `_depositFor()` adjusts `supply` as if new tokens are being added, whereas in a merge operation, the total locked amount should remain unchanged â€“ the locks are merely being consolidated.

### Impact

This flaw leads to an inflation of the `supply` value, thereby distorting the true representation of total locked tokens. This misrepresentation can affect:

1. **Accurate Tracking of Locked Tokens:** The inflated `supply` could mislead users and systems interacting with the contract regarding the actual amount of tokens locked.
2. **Dependent Calculations and Metrics:** Any functionality or metrics dependent on the total supply of locked tokens may be compromised, leading to incorrect calculations or reward distributions.

### Recommendations

To rectify this issue, an additional condition should be added in the `_depositFor()` function to ensure that `supply` is not incremented during a merge operation:

```diff 
-       supply = supplyBefore + _value;
+       if (depositType != DepositType.MERGE_TYPE) {
+            supply = supplyBefore + _value;
+        }
```
